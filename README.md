This repository contains a Python project that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform text documents into graph structures and store them in a Neo4j database. The project uses the `LLMGraphTransformer` from the `langchain_experimental` library and integrates with Neo4j to create a powerful text-to-graph pipeline.
