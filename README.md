This repository contains a Python project that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform text documents into graph structures and store them in a Neo4j database. The project uses the `LLMGraphTransformer` from the `langchain_experimental` library and integrates with Neo4j to create a powerful text-to-graph pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Text to Graph Transformation:** Convert textual data into structured graph documents.
- **Neo4j Integration:** Store and manage graph structures in a Neo4j database.
- **Customizable:** Easily modify and extend the transformation and storage processes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Neo4j database (with credentials and URI)
- Ollama installed with the `llama3` model pulled
